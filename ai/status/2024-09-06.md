## Summary

This session focused on enhancing the user interface and experience of the analogy generation tool. Key improvements include a more versatile input component, dynamic complexity selection, and better navigation with a collapsible sidebar and breadcrumb. The next session should focus on implementing the quiz and flashcard generation features, as well as refining the AI response handling and error management.
