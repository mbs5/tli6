# Development Update

## Development Steps

1. Implemented Replicate AI integration:

   - Created `lib/replicate.ts` to initialize the Replicate client
   - Added `actions/replicate-actions.ts` with `generateAnalogy` server action

2. Set up basic UI components using shadcn:

   - Added `components/ui/button.tsx`, `input.tsx`, `Container.tsx`, `Heading.tsx`, `Text.tsx`, and `Box.tsx`
   - Created `components/ui/index.ts` to export all UI components

3. Developed Analogies page:

   - Created `app/analogies/page.tsx` as a client component
   - Implemented form submission and message display logic

4. Updated project configuration:

   - Modified `tailwind.config.ts` to include shadcn theme configuration
   - Updated `app/globals.css` with shadcn base styles

5. Added utility functions:
   - Created `lib/utils.ts` with `cn` function for class name merging

## Key Decisions

1. Chose Replicate AI for analogy generation:

   - Provides flexibility and control over the AI model
   - Allows for easy integration with Next.js server actions

2. Adopted shadcn UI components:

   - Offers a consistent and customizable design system
   - Improves development speed and maintainability

3. Implemented client-side state management for chat history:

   - Provides immediate feedback to users
   - Reduces server load by managing UI state on the client

4. Used Next.js 14 app router and server actions:
   - Leverages latest Next.js features for improved performance and developer experience
   - Simplifies server-side logic integration

## Summary

The project has made significant progress in setting up the core functionality for generating analogies using Replicate AI. The UI has been established using shadcn components, providing a solid foundation for further development. The next session should focus on refining the user experience, implementing error handling, and potentially adding features like complexity selection for analogies.
